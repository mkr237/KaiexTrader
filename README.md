# Kaiex Trader

KaiexTrader (name TBC) is a algorthmic trading engine for decentralised crypto exchanges. It is a WIP but the intention is to provide initial support for DYDX and a simple framework for the creation and execution of algorithmic trading strategies.  Beyond that, it is envisaged that further exchanges could be added as well order book aggregation and smart order routing.
